            I have no idea what I'm supposed to place in an about section.
            Probably something about my name, what I love, what I do, and any
            other information to help you get to know me better. Well, I don't
            even know whether anyone is going to see this particular blog
            anyway. But here goes nothing:
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Willow (yes, that's actually my real name). I'm a software
            engineer. I love learning (very strange, I know). But I really do
            enjoy learning, and I have so many interests. So, I guess that's
            enough about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I already have a blog on Medium, but I stopped writing there because
            I realized I was writing for views, and it was hampering my
            creativity. Plus, if you have an audience focused on one niche on
            Medium, it's a bit difficult to write about all your random thoughts
            and opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I created thisâ€”something like an online diary where I can write
            about anything and everything I think or learn about. I promise to
            express myself as honestly as I can, even to the detriment of my
            reputation (unhinged lol ðŸ¤ª).
        </p>
        <p>
            So here goes nothing. I hope you have a swell time here, and you can
            write to me <a href="mailto:khorus43@gmail.com">here</a>
            if you want to tell me anything too. Letâ€™s take offðŸš€!
