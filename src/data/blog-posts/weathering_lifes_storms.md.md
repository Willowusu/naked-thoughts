publishDate: 16 Jun 2024
description: A personal reflection on the challenges of enduring difficult times in life, often described metaphorically as "weathering storms." It conveys the idea that while going through tough phases, it may feel like the difficulties will never end. However, the author reassures both themselves and the reader that these hardships are temporary and will eventually pass.

In life, we go through a lot of challenges and tribulations. The thing is, when you're going through the storm, it does not look like it's going to get better. It looks like whatever you're going through is going to last forever. Trust me, I've been there. There have been consecutive months in my life where everything just seems to go to shit. Nothing seems to be working out. It's so difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel or whatever they say. But at the same time, there's a little voice at the back of my head that tells me it's going to get better. That it's actually going to be alright.

Do we always listen to this little voice? More often than not, we completely tune it out and tell ourselves whatever we are going through is going to last forever. I'm here to say that it won't. On the occasions when I speak to a friend about whatever storm they're going through, most of them tell me I have no idea what they're feeling. To be honest, I don't. Everyone's storm is unique and everyone's storm is different. I can never feel or comprehend what they may be going through, but what I try to let them understand is that our storms have a commonality: it will stop one day.

It's very hard to believe that when life is kicking your ass on all sides, but that's the truth. It's not going to remain dark forever. It's not going to be a storm forever. It's not going to be a burning furnace forever. It will cease one day, and on that day, you will look back and understand that it was just a phase.

So, if I am writing this today, it's just to encourage myself and whoever reads this that no storm lasts forever. The pain, heartbreak, torment, and all the negative feelings will not last forever. It's bound to end. What you need is patience and a reassuring voice in your heart and at the back of your mind that it will surely end one day.

I'm done with this. I know my thoughts seem scattered, but I hope you find the message I was trying to deliver in there.
